# abstract-algebra-for-fun
A beginner's naive project implementing some basic notions about free groups and related topics from abstract algebra. The concepts are presented as viewed by a mathematician rather than by a software engineer. The author is just learning essential features of Java and is not familiar with all design patterns, good practices etc. :)
